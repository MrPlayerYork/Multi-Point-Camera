## About <a name = "about"></a>

Multi-Point Camera is a datapack tool that gives you an easy to setup camera track to be used for cinematic or timelapse videos. The tool lets you fly around in spectator mode and setup waypoints for the camera to track to. With built-in anticheat, spectator mode will be taken away when a player tries to fly through blocks and be teleported back to where the command was run. Spectator mode also has a range that can be set in the function settings.

The camera has a few options when setting up, one of which is preview mode. Preview mode will show you a rough path that the camera will take before typing the start camera command.

MPC is made with efficency in mind and uses as little resources as possible. Flight paths can be stored away for future uses and the most recent path will be kept, unless the delete command is run.

### Installing <a name = "install"></a>

Setup is super simple. The zip file of the datapack is setup so all you need to do is drag and drop the folder into your datapacks folder. If you are unsure if the pack is running, you can type `/trigger mpctest` and the pack will let you know if it's running.
